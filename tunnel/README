FNAL Tunnel
===========

This a simple reverse proxy SSH tunnel, so that CHIPS may receive spills from Fermilab.

The SSH connection is wrapped in AutoSSH for robustness against network disruptions.
Furthermore, AutoSSH is wrapped inside k5reauth to renew Krb5 tickets every now and then.
The main point of entry is `spill_tunnel.sh`, which is wrapped inside a Systemd service
`chips-tunnel.service`. To (un)install it, run `make install` (or `make uninstall`).

Make sure you have all dependencies by running the following command:

```
# yum install autossh krb5-workstation
```
