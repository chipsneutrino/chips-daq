#  CHIPS Monitoring Tunnel Configuration File
#
#  Note: This file was automatically generated by the deploy script and will
#        be overwritten upon the next deployment. To make lasting changes,
#        edit the corresponding template located in the "./scripts/config"
#        directory of the DAQ repository, and re-deploy.
#
#  Syntax of this file follows the standard libconfig specification v1.7.2.
#  However, since this file is sourced from a Bourne Again Shell script,
#  applicable syntax is limited to the intersection in grammars of both
#  scripting languages. (Specifically, not no spaces in assignments!)
#
#  Information about the current deployment follows.
