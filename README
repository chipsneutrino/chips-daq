####  DAQonite  ####

DAQonite is the main DAQ program. It collects optical and monitoring packets and saves the data
to .root files. It also displays graphical monitoring information.

Usage:
"./daqonite"    (By default this shows the monitoring GUI, but will not save data files when running)
"./daqonite -s" (This will show the monitoring GUI and will save data files when running)

You then command the running daqonite program using "daq_command" which takes three options and
additional arguments specifying the run type e.g.

Usage:

"./daq_command start 2" (Starts a run of type 2. Will stop and save a current run and start a new one)
"./daq_command stop"    (Stop and save the current run)
"./daq_command exit"    (Exits DAQonite)

Notes:
    - Currently both the optical and monitoring data are only collected when a run is in progress.
      Therefore, the monitoring GUI will not update unless a run is in progress. TODO: Have the 
      monitoring always running.

    - The filenames are determined using the run type and run number for that type which is stored
      in the file "data/runNumbers.dat". All data files are then saved to the data file. TODO: Be
      able to specify the data directory.
