/**
 * InfiniteSpillScheduler - Scheduler that produces only a single infinitely-long
 * spill
 * 
 * This scheduler is the most trivial, as it effectively implements the "always
 * live" detector behaviour. This is immensely useful for maintenance and debugging.
 * However, it comes at a cost of potentially unbounded memory consumption. Since the
 * spill never ends, hits that accumulate in it are not processed until the run is
 * manually stopped. Obviously, if left running for too long, this will eventually
 * exhaust RAM.
